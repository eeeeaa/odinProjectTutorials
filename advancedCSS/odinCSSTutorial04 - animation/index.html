        This is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that animates between
        <code>display: none; opacity: 0</code> and
        <code>display: block; opacity: 1</code>. Neat, huh?
      </div>

      <p>
        This is another paragraph to show that <code>display: none; </code> is
        being applied and removed on the above <code>&lt;div&gt; </code>. If
        only its <code>opacity</code> was being changed, it would always take up
        the space in the DOM.

        The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
        at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
        her in a languid, sleepy voice.
